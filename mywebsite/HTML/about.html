                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>I am a dynamic and accomplished professional with a robust background in Economics, Business, and Interactive Digital Media. I'm currently pursuing a Master's degree in Interactive Digital Media from Trinity College Dublin, where I honed my technical skills in Unreal Engine 5 (C++), JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Maya, 3DS Max, and developed a keen eye for UX design through various certifications in prototyping, multidevice design, and web interaction design. My career aspirations include becoming a video game developer or designer. I completed my Bachelor in Economics and double major in Business from Koc University. After acquiring nearly 4 years of professional experience in Finance, Investment, Marketing and Advertising industries, I decided to shift my career to design and development. Outside of my professional interests, I love jazz music and express that by singing and playing the tenor saxophone.</p>
